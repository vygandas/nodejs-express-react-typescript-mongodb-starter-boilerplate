# Backend & Frontend: Node.Js Express JWT TypeScript API Mongo Mongoose React Redux Project Starter Boilerplate

This project is for starting quickly projects that require authentication and is based on JS technology stack. 
There're common interfaces separated into 3rd package and included both in `api` and `client` packages. This way you'll have same structures in both front-end and back-end.

## How to start

1. Do `npm i` on `client` and `api`
2. Fill in `.env` values (For mongodb you can use mLabs)
3. Start backend server `cd api/ && npm run dev`
4. Start client server `cd client/ && npm start`
